# Tutorial Workbooks & Notebooks

In Xcalar Design, Workbooks represent interactive sessions where you connect to data sources and model your dataflows. Workbooks can be serialized as files. Within a workbook, a user can create multiple worksheets, each with multiple tables of data. Xcalar Design also includes Jupyter Notebook integration, which enables you to write code directly in the browser, interactively analyze data from a table, and create user-defined functions (UDFs). A workbook can contain multiple notebooks.

The Jupyter Notebook integration assists in adding custom functionality to Xcalar by harnessing User Defined Functions, as well as building data visualizations, and implementing analytical and data-science algorithms to use with Xcalar Design.

Xcalar University Tutorial Workbooks are organized to help you learn how to write Xcalar UDFs using Jupyter Notebooks. It expects basic knowledge of Python and familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks.
