# Tutorail Workbooks & Notebooks

In Xcalar Design, Workbooks represent interactive sessions where you connect to data sources and model your dataflows. Workbooks can be serialized as files. Within a workbook a user can create multiple worksheets, each with multiple tables of data. Xcalar Design also includes Jupyter Notebook integration, which enables you to write code directly in the browser, interactively analyze data from a table, and create user-defined functions (UDFs). A workbook can contain multiple notebooks.

Jupyter Notebook integration is designed to assist in adding custom functionality to Xcalar by leveraging User Defined Functions, as well as build data visualizations and implement analytical and data-science algorithms to use with Xcalar Design. 

Xcalar University Tutorial Workbooks are organized in a way to help you learn how to use Xcalar UDFs and Jupyter Notebooks, it expects basic knowledge of Python and familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks. The first <a href="https://github.com/xcalar/xcalar-university/blob/master/Hello%20UDFs%20Tutorial/jupyterNotebooks/0%20-%20Introduction.ipynb">Hello UDFs Workbook</a> will give you an introduction into this reach and exciting world of capabilities and data adventures.
