    "In Xcalar Design, Workbooks represent interactive sessions where you connect to data sources and model your dataflows. Workbooks can be serialized as files. Within a workbook a user can create multiple worksheets, each with multiple tables of data. Xcalar Design included Jupyter Notebook to make it easier to write and debug code directly in the browser, interactively analyze data from a table, and create user-defined functions (UDFs). A workbook can contain multiple Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook integration is designed to assist in adding custom functionality to Xcalar by leveraging User Defined Functions, as well as by building data visualizations and implement analytical and data-science algorithms to use with Xcalar Design. For more on Jupyter integration please refer to <a href=\"#integration\">Xcalar & Jupyter Notebook Integration</a> section below.\n",

The first Tutorial Workbook that you have opened now introduces into this reach and exciting world of programming capabilities and data adventures in Xcalar."

In such cases Xcalar import UDFs allow modification of your data during the import process.\n",
